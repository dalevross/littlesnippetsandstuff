<p>I wrote an email to my younger self in 2013. I'll just make it a list with minor edits identified</p>

<blockquote cite="dross@dajengroug.com">
    <ul>
        <b>Myself</b>
        <li>Thanks for being who you were to allow me to be the me I am today.</li>
        <li>You are capable of effecting the change you have always dreamed about.</li>
        <li> You have within you the passion, desire and confidence to execute on activities many fear to even imagine.
        </li>
        <li>Never again doubt yourself. Keep the dream alive, be hopeful despite the despair expressed by others.</li>
        <li> Nothing is too strange, too crazy to attempt to achieve.</li>
        <li> Failure is not the end, just a new beginning. Love, laugh, dream and see the world change from your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Do not let anyone steal your joy no matter how hard it may be. I love you, sir.</li>
        <li>You are a rock star.</li>

        <b>My Partner</b>
        <li>Treat Jenneil like the queen she is.</li>
        <li>Give her love daily.
        <li>She loves you very much and will be by your side always.</li>
        <li> Support her dreams as she supports yours.</li>
        <li>Take a break sometimes and relax</li>
        <li>Enjoy the universe with your prize.</li>
    </ul>

I added the headings. My named wife would, of course, be my future wife and I would've hoped she'd be as loving and
supportive as my wife was. This was a year before experiences that led me to a discovery about myself that shook my
foundation. Nix the rockstar and I'm currently revising what I'd say today beyond what you've said of course :)
